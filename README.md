# About the Project
The idea of this driver is to provide a more intuitive driver than HAL, and improve my C / ARM skills. In addition, this driver aims to provide various functions for testing, such as ready-made functions of various sensors, math and control functions, digital filters, handling of standard protocols (UART, I2C, SPI, etc) and much more.
### ***Currently the driver only supports H7 families***
- [x] H7
- [ ] F1
- [ ] ..


## Project Status

### * Beta 0.9

- [x] GPIO
- [ ] UART
- [ ] CLOCK
